/// Not every combinations of floats is valid geometry. Some types of objects are required to fulfill a constraint in order to be valid geometry. We call this the (anti) geometric constraint. If a type of object may possibly violate this constraint, then it will implement this trait. The constraint is violated if a non-zero value is returned. See also AntiConstraintValid and AntiFix.
