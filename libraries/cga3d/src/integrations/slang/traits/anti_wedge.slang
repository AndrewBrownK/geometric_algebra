/// AntiWedge
/// The AntiWedge product is the dual operation to the Wedge product, that depends on a specified AntiScalar. It combines BasisElements by which parts are missing, instead of which parts are present. For example, with an AntiScalar of e1234, anti_wedge(e423, e321) = e23. This behaves something like an intersection of the subscripts in the BasisElements.
